                <br><br/>

            <h3>Admission</h3>

                people, please contact us to arrange the tour.</p>
                <br><br/>

                It also has audio guides and braille display signs

            <h2>Get Involved</h2>
            <h3>Support</h3>
            <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
                very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible 
                to the whole community. 
                You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. 
                If you have some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, 
                please let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they 
                will be able to assist you.</p>
                <br><br/>

            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays 
                in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has 
                its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, 
                access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers 
                come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d 
                like to find out more about how you can get involved.</p>
                <br><br/>

             <h3>Internships</h3> 
             <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement 
                of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right 
                person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
                You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are
                passionate about science and sharing it with the wider community.</p>
