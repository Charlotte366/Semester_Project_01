            <h1>Explore together</h1>
            <p> Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science 
                accessible to all.
                Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding 
                of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the 
                very building blocks of life itself.
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of 
                our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration
                of the world around us.
                We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through
                exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects
                of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and 
                play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits
                – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>

             <h2>Explore for kids</h2>
             <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum,
                there’s plenty to see and do.
                You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time 
                and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested 
                minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
                We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday
                between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
                During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children
                your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. 
                To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.</p>

            <h2>For teachers</h2>
             <p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places

                tours of the museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great 
                video presentations that will excite and inspire them.
                Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to

                its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, 
                access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers 
                come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d 
                like to find out more about how you can get involved.
